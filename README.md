# VTIL-Hello

Example CMake project for VTIL.

## Compiling

You need Visual Studio 2019 (required, older version will not work), then clone the repo and do the following:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..
```

This will generate `VTIL-Hello.sln`, which you can open in Visual Studio to build the project.
